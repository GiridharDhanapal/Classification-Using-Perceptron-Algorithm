# Classification-Using-Perceptron-Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Perceptron algorithm for binary and multi class classification tasks. The implementation is done without utilizing any external libraries, focusing on understanding the fundamental workings of the Perceptron algorithm in Python. The project involves training and testing classifiers on provided datasets (train.data and test.data) to classify instances into different classes based on feature values.

## Objectives

**The main objectives of this project are:**

Implementing the Perceptron algorithm in Python.

Performing binary classification between pairs of classes.

Extending the algorithm using the 1-vs-rest approach for multi-class classification.

Evaluate classification accuracies and explore regularization effects.
